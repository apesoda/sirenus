#### Overview
Anyone is welcome to submit patches to the project

#### Web UI

##### Notes
Tailwind is set up to scan all HTML files in `templates/` for classes, as well as all SVG's in `templates/svg`. Any Tailwind classes applied to files of those formats in those places will automatically be recognized and applied.
